# Poke-Search!
This task was not too hard, it was managable. I was previously accustomed to using tkinter for my projects, it was my first time using PySide6 and it took some time for me to pick it up. The task took me around three and a half evenings to complete.

I didn't do this task at the time of my initial submission. I did it later in February, but was on the fence about pushing it to the repo as I had already submitted the tasks and didn't think that was allowed.
