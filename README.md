## SELF INTRO
Hi There!<br>
I'm Vishnu Tejas E, a first-year Computer Science (AI) student at ASC. My passion for technology has been a constant in my life, and I've been exploring its various facets with great enthusiasm. My coding journey commenced four years ago with Python. From a young age, I was intrigued by technology, and one memorable experience was using a publicly available video downloading tool. However, discomfort with the excessive ads led me to learn Python and create my own video downloader. Since then, my journey has been nothing short of amazing.

## INTROSPECTION
### WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
My fascination with technology has been ingrained in me for as long as I can remember. Building numerous personal projects has not only been a hobby but a source of immense joy. Through this, I discovered a deep-seated passion for programming and crafting software and gadgets. I make it a point to stay abreast of the latest technological developments, dedicating myself to learning new technologies each day. My daily routine involves using multiple open-source applications, and I proudly advocate for both open-source software and hardware. The very ethos of openness is what resonates with me most about amFOSS, and I am committed to contributing to the open-source community and amFOSS to the best of my abilities.

### WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
I'm contemplating the development of an open-source platform with functionalities akin to the flipper-zero. To explore its feasibility, I've initiated research and purchased a Raspberry Pi Pico to experiment with the RP2040 platform. Considering the success of tools like Pwnagotchi, which utilizes RP2040, it seems like a viable direction. Alongside this project, I aim to enhance my programming skills and invest time in general studies for overall improvement.

### HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I aspire to contribute to the club's enhancement of projects and events. I am committed to actively participating in every event and competition, doing my utmost to be present and involved.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
The tasks appear to be well-organized, straightforward, and structured in terms of both order and complexity. The team has done an outstanding job in defining these tasks, successfully achieving the objectives outlined in the introduction to the tasks.
